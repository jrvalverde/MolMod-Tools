<pre>"potSel" Color Surface by Potential 1.0
---------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS: VMD Version 1.6 or greater

DESCRIPTION:
        Uses Delphi to show e-static potl on molecular surface

PROCEDURES:
        potSurf <vmd_selection> <grid count=""> <dielectric_in> <dielectric_out>

EXAMPLE USAGE:
        source potsurf.tcl
        mol pdbload 1bnf
        set sel [atomselect top "not water"]
        potSurf $sel 63 2 80

        A new molexcule is loaded, an msms surface colored by
        potential at atomic positions
        red = neagative, white = neutral, blue = positive (Grasp style)

        To adjust color range, change msms-&gt; vdw rep
        adjust color min, midpoint in Color menu,
        then change that rep back, vdw-&gt;msms

        Note: Super-hacky, charge and radius problems still pending
              Also, requires Delphi installation, not ubiquitous.
