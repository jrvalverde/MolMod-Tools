# NAME
#	make_ext_index - make an extended index of a coordinate file
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	make_ext_index coordinates
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Coordinates must be a filename ending in .pdb or .gro containing
#	the atomic coordinates of a protein or protein complex.
#
#	If the input file is in PDB format, it will be scanned for the
#	existence of chains, and each chain will be indexed separately,
#	with all atoms and ligands that have not been assigned to a chain
#	being added into chain 'Z'.
#
#	If the input file is in Gromacs format, it will simply be indexed.
#
#	In either case, the coordinates will be scanned for the presence
#	of Water and possibly ions. If there are, two additional indexes
#	will be built, one for solvent (water and ions) and one for the
#	solute(s) containing protein and ligands.
#
# CAVEAT
#	We are assuming that the system is not already using chain 'Z'.
#	This may be a little too optimistic.
#
#	If there are atoms that should belong to the same chain but are
#	not labelled as such, said atoms will be taken 'out' of their chain
#	and assigned to chain 'Z'.
