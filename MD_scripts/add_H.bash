# NAME
#	add_H - add hydrogens to a PDB file
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	add_H input.pdb method pH
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Adds hydrogens to the specified input file using one of a number
#	of methods. The supported methods are
#		babel chimera reduce haad gromacs none
#
#	The available methods will depend on the existence of the required
#	external programs. At a minimum, 'none' (do not add H) is always
# 	available.
#
#	Currently, the recommended methods are chimera or reduce
#
#	pH is optional, defaults to 7.365 and is only used by 'babel'
#
#	At the end, you will get two files named after the input file,
#		$input-H.pdb	- the input file without H
#		$input+H.pdb	- the input file with the added H (if any)
#
#	It relies on external variables to locate auxiliary programs, but
#	tries to provide sensible defaults in case these external variables
#	are not defined. It also relies on the existence of a WATER global
#	variable to use if the 'gromacs' method is selected.
